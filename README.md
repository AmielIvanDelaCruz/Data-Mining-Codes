This code was utilized during Phase 3 of the Data Mining process and accomplished the following tasks:

* Model Selection: Chose appropriate algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression, or clustering), such as Decision Tree, k-NN, and others.

* Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the selected model(s), and generated predictions.

* Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using relevant evaluation metrics â€” such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, or R-squared and RMSE for regression tasks.

* Results Submission: Compiled and submitted the model evaluation results, including visualizations for better interpretation and analysis.
